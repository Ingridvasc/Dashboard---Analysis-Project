# About the Project 👇🏼

The dashboard was implemented for a photovoltaic project analysis, where battery loss and sizing was the essential pillar of the project. With the evaluation period of 20 years, several factors that affected the analysis were analyzed, such as: inflation, minimum attractiveness rate, the battery that would be chosen, constrained-off assumptions.
